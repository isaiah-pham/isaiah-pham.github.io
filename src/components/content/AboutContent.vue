    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Hi, I'm Isaiah, a computer science student graduating with a Bachelor's from Clemson
      University in December 2025. I am looking for a full-time job after graduation, and I am open
      to relocating anywhere in the US.

      <br /><br />

      With experience in full-stack development, I love solving problems with clean, readable code.
      Outside of work and computer science, my main interests involve music, cooking, sports, and
      board games.
